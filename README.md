- **MVP**:
Forms (inputs), button feedback, music source data, application timer/timeout.

- **Post-MVP**:
Video integration, leveling, soundcasing and feedback. Adding song by title to the accompanying container. Leveling system where the farther the user goes, the harder the lyrics will come - either by elimination of certain words or by gathering data outside of 'Top 10 Songs'. 

- **Goals**:
Well-optimized countdown lyrical game w/ all requirements met and a slider timer optimization.
